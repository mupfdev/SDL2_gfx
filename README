\section intro_sec Introduction

The SDL2_gfx library provides the basic drawing functions such as lines,
circles or polygons provided by SDL_gfx on SDL2 against renderers of SDL2.

The current components of the SDL2_gfx library are:
- Graphic Primitives (SDL_gfxPrimitives.h, SDL_gfxPrimitives.c)
- Surface Rotozoomer (SDL_rotozoom.h, SDL_rotozoom.c)
- Framerate control (SDL_framerate.h, SDL_framerate.c)
- MMX image filters (SDL_imageFilter.h, SDL_imageFilter.c)
- Build-in 8x8 Font (SDL_gfxPrimitives_font.h)

Note that SDL2_gfx is compatible with SDL version 2.0 (not SDL 1.2).
